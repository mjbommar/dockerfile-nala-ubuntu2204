# NB: This is a demo Dockerfile for Ubuntu 22.04 that includes basic setup for the nala "wrapper" around libapt, which
# can substantially speed up build processes involving large numbers of apt/deb package installs.
# Combine with a local mirror or apt proxy cache for maximum impact.
# To learn more about nala, see https://gitlab.com/volian/nala.
